And you know, so there will be a ton of tickets to begin with and then as you decide, okay, well, what are the first things we want to implement, you know, maybe your teams decided on looking at about a two or three-week development cycle, you'll pull in tickets to your selected for development, which hopefully you'll be able to accomplish within two to three weeks. And you know, everyone might get one two, maybe three tickets depending on how much time you tend to set on the club again and then
 In progress is where you'll pull a ticket when you actually start working on it. Hopefully tickets won't travel backwards in the pipeline. But you know, sometimes things come up, you know something you are swamped at school and you can't work on something anymore and maybe you're going to pass off someone else whatever just move that back to the select for development then in your view is for obviously when it's interview. So it's when you set up a PR and get Hub and you're trying to get other teammates to
 Yourself and then done is to spot real put stuff when it's merge to master. And then I think for pastors specifically I know and ideally Master will be Deployable. So with us CI pipeline it'll get deployed right away for other teams. That might not be the case. You guys might have like deployments on a set schedule. Who knows? Well that again will vary team by team, but hopefully this is kind of like a good guy.
 I'm going to get people going in like to be able to stay organized with your team and know what other teammates are working on.
 And now I'm thinking like about getting everyone kind of in their groups. Try to get everyone's set up making their GitHub project and really start working on some user stories and talking about what they want to start designing the past because these are stories or I find to my level where they can be to high levels of nice break from them so past. Yeah.
 User story of growing buzzbaits. Yeah, you can be any that's kind of what they use the labels were. Yeah. I saw it as you're making it there's a related. Yeah, but yeah, so I mean, yeah, you just always kept excuse me can be really high level, but I think ideally you'll be able to
 describe it as
 Like I mean this this ticket for example, does it really need a sub tasks and I agree that some user stories doing some tasks and maybe we'll figure out some sort of way of making like essentially like epics which maybe you'll have like this epic user story that has a bunch of sub-stories or something. I don't know if anyone's familiar with using like things like jira or things like that. There's a half
 - yeah, like an epic right? So that's like a big thing compassing idea and then we can put some tasks like yeah, I actually don't know how the his mansion in GitHub and that's a good point. I don't know if anyone knows off the top of their head if you can do that. You can't know. Okay, so oh, yes. Yeah totally totally not. Yeah, I think just to start obviously most are going to be used to stories because they're going to be new features for you right there is going to be some
 Out that are going to be like bugs and it's just going to describe like what the bug is and maybe you have someone who's writing the ticket has some background knowledge of like what might be causing the issue. So there might be able to point people in the right direction. But yeah, I think we'll kind of gets that later right now. Obviously, we no one's written anything. So there's no funds because no code. Yeah, I think
 well, I guess I will have to fix those if they come up but yeah, anywho, so any questions about like kind of like what I'm talking about here, this is like for those that don't know this is kind of like the general like Agile development process that is like a like a springboard or like a kanban board. I don't know. There's like a lot of different Agile development processes. I don't think we're going to follow anyone in particular.
 Because I think trying to force your team to follow one specific practice is actually not a good idea. I think you should figure out what works best for your team and considering we are not stiff likes it considering where students and we're not working on this all the time. I think it makes sense for us to do some sort of hybrid approach, but in general the ideas of saying you got all the columns tickets that you're working on an assigned to and you can view what everyone's kind of.
 Working on at a glance with those boards.
 I just asked me questions on that now. Okay, so I think it's kind of what we want to do now is actually just yeah, I try to meet up with our groups right now and start talking about like or start creating some tickets. No, is anyone here not have like a team?
 Yeah, just just one. Okay, I'll just get you to come like talk to me and we can get you on a team. But so I know the Lea leave for a schedule courses right here. So it might as well get scheduled forced people to come be over here. I'm like the lead for passer right now. So I'll like probably meet like up there then we've got the leads for lecture down here. So we'll get lecture to meet up here and then we got the bug Labs website or over there with.
 So if you want to just like move around and sit down with the people that you're teamed up with and then we can kind of get started but I think the idea is that we'll build up rainstorm our first initial features and kind of get those project board set up. I think this would be good creative time to start defining the project as a whole.
